# Semantic-textual-similarity
Semantic textual similarity deals with determining how similar a pair of text documents are. 
The goal is to implement a new architecture to solve the issue based on state-of-the-art papers.

- Siamese Recurrent Architectures for Learning Sentence Similarity, Jonas Mueller et. al.
- A Structured Self-Attentive Sentence Embedding, Zhouhan Lin et. al.
